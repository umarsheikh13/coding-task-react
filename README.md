### Packages

This is a summary of the third party packages used in the app.

| Name | Reason |
|--|--|
| axios | This was used to help make remote requests to the api. |
| modern-normalize | This was used to reset the default styles of the app to create a more normalised base. |

### Notes

- I didn't include a component library as I felt it would be relevant to display my css skills (used through SASS).
- I've included all the code in one file (`App.tsx`) so it's easier for you to look through.
- If this was a more complex app, a lot of the code in the would be separated out into more reusable code (e.g. components, hooks, etc).
